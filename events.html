<h1 class="collapsible">Session 2
	<div class="plus">+</div>
</h1>
<div class="content">
  <p>July 16 to August 14, 2020</p>
  <p>Session 2 was divided into two sprints. Students learned about the design procces with a focus on adressing these prompts.</p> <br>
  <h2>Sprint 1: July 16th â€“ 19th</h2> <br>
  <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> Your school wants to strengthen the community by encouraging ways to unite students in their interests and experiences. Design an experience that facilitates natural, inclusive and safe school programming for Fall 2020. You will need to research and decide exactly which pocket of the community you want to design for, and whether your MVP facilitates safe in-person, on-campus programming or provides an alternative solution. Consider the needs of those who plan the events, as well as the students who these events are for.</p><br>
  <p><strong>Background:</strong> On-campus programming provides opportunities for students to meet people, make friends, engage with their interests and build skills. Between clubs, sports, study groups, and simply hanging out with friends on the lawns, meeting others outside of classes is fundamental to the Columbia University experience and allows students to find communities which matter to them.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Sprint 2: July 31st â€“ August 14th</h2> <br>
  <p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> Your school wants to encourage students to find and build inspiring and empowering relationships with mentors. Design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover each other. Examples of mentorships include upperclassmen mentors to help first-years adjust to university life; industry and career mentors to advance the skills and networks of students within a particular industry; identity-based mentors to empower and grow the networks within particular communities, such as BIPOC, Latinx, FGLI. You will need to research and decide exactly which pocket of the community you want to design for, and deliver a high-fidelity prototype of your MVP by the end of the sprint. Consider the needs of both mentors and mentees, including how someone may become a mentor and how to connect mentors to mentees.</p><br>
  <p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Your school wants to help students graduate with a better understanding of their career options and interests. Design an experience that helps students explore opportunities for careers. Career-finding opportunities might include volunteer work, internships (full-time, part-time, remote), pre-professional organisations (on and off campus), undergraduate research, informational interviews, on-site visits etc. Keep in mind that students have differing needs and priorities when exploring career paths, including financial stability, location of work, further study requirements, prestige, and more. You will need to research and decide exactly which pocket of the community you want to design for, and deliver a high-fidelity prototype of your MVP by the end of the sprint.</p>
